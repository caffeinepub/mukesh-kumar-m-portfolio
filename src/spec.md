# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the portfolio's color scheme and background to reflect a design-focused aesthetic, moving away from the current teal/emerald palette to colors that represent UI/UX design and creative work.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace teal/emerald color scheme with design-focused colors throughout the portfolio
- Update AnimatedBackground component with design-related visual patterns
- Apply new color palette to all glassmorphism effects, gradients, and overlays across all sections
- Update Tailwind CSS configuration and CSS variables with new design-focused color values in OKLCH color space

**User-visible outcome:** The portfolio will display a new color scheme and background design that better represents the UI/UX design domain, with updated visual styling throughout while maintaining all existing functionality and accessibility standards.
