# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Transform the portfolio into a Mobbin-inspired premium UI with advanced Framer Motion animations, glassmorphism design, and UI/UX developer-themed micro-interactions.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all scroll animations with Framer Motion featuring staggered children, spring physics, parallax effects, and micro-interactions across all sections
- Implement glassmorphism cards with backdrop blur, subtle borders, and gradient overlays for About, Experience, Projects, Skills, and Contact sections
- Add interactive micro-interactions including magnetic cursor effects, morphing shapes on hover, ripple click effects, and smooth section transitions
- Enhance Hero section with animated gradient text, floating UI element mockups with parallax depth, and particle background effects
- Add reveal-on-scroll mask animations (wipes, circles, splits) for content throughout sections
- Implement premium Project card hover effects with 3D tilt, cursor-following spotlight, and glow transformations
- Add animated background mesh gradient that morphs and shifts colors subtly
- Enhance Skills bento grid with magnetic hover effects between cards, staggered flip animations, and pulsing skill icon glows
- Add smooth page transition overlays with animated loading states between major sections
- Implement scroll-linked animations for progress bars, timeline drawing, and viewport-based element morphing

**User-visible outcome:** The portfolio will feature a premium, Mobbin-style design with sophisticated glassmorphism aesthetics and smooth Framer Motion animations throughout. Users will experience magnetic cursor effects, 3D card tilts, parallax depth, mask reveal animations, and scroll-linked transformations that showcase UI/UX development expertise.
