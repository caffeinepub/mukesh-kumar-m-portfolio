  "summary": "The diff implements advanced animations and glassmorphism UI enhancements using CSS animations, Intersection Observer, and mouse tracking. However, it does NOT use Framer Motion as required. Key requirements like mask reveal animations, magnetic button effects, ripple clicks, section transition overlays, and magnetic hover between skill cards are missing. Several micro-interactions and premium effects are not implemented.",

      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Replace all existing scroll animations with Framer Motion-based advanced animations including staggered children, spring physics, parallax effects, and micro-interactions",
      "reason": "The implementation uses Intersection Observer and CSS animations instead of Framer Motion. While useFramerAnimations.ts hook file exists, it's not imported or used in any components.",
